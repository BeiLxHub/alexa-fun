# ews-cars
An Alexa skill that lets you search for rental cars from Expedia
You can find cars based on a three-letter airport code (e.g. SFO)
A pickup date (and time) as well as a dropoff date (and time) can be specified
If not present, the time defaults to 10:00 AM, and dates default to a search
7 days from the current date with a 2-day rental

The chepaest five results are read, and the user can ask for details
about one of them by number.  The URL for the Expedia details page will be
added to the Alexa app in this case.
